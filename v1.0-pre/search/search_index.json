Receivers will still be\n    able to drain the pending values on the channel, but after that, subsequent\n    [`receive()`][frequenz.channels.Receiver.receive] calls will raise a\n    [`ReceiverStoppedError`][frequenz.channels.ReceiverStoppedError] exception.\n\n    This channel is useful, for example, to distribute work across multiple workers.\n\n    In cases where each message need to be received by every receiver, a\n    [broadcast][frequenz.channels.Broadcast] channel may be used.\n\n    # Examples\n\n    Example: Send a few numbers to a receiver\n        This is a very simple example that sends a few numbers from a single sender to\n        a single receiver.\n\n        ```python\n        import asyncio\n\n        from frequenz.channels import Anycast, Sender\n\n\n        async def send(sender: Sender[int]) -&gt; None:\n            for msg in range(3):\n                print(f\"sending {msg}\")\n                await sender.send(msg)\n\n\n        async def main() -&gt; None:\n            channel = Anycast[int](name=\"numbers\")\n\n            sender = channel.new_sender()\n            receiver = channel.new_receiver()\n\n            async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as task_group:\n                task_group.create_task(send(sender))\n                for _ in range(3):\n                    msg = await receiver.receive()\n                    print(f\"received {msg}\")\n                    await asyncio.sleep(0.1)  # sleep (or work) with the data\n\n\n        asyncio.run(main())\n        ```\n\n        The output should look something like (although the sending and received might\n        appear more interleaved):\n\n        ```\n        sending 0\n        sending 1\n        sending 2\n        received 0\n        received 1\n        received 2\n        ```\n\n    Example: Send a few number from multiple senders to multiple receivers\n        This is a more complex example that sends a few numbers from multiple senders to\n        multiple receivers, using a small buffer to force the senders to block.\n\n        ```python\n        import asyncio\n\n        from frequenz.channels import Anycast, Receiver, ReceiverStoppedError, Sender\n\n\n        async def send(name: str, sender: Sender[int], start: int, stop: int) -&gt; None:\n            for msg in range(start, stop):\n                print(f\"{name} sending {msg}\")\n                await sender.send(msg)\n\n\n        async def recv(name: str, receiver: Receiver[int]) -&gt; None:\n            try:\n                async for msg in receiver:\n                    print(f\"{name} received {msg}\")\n                await asyncio.sleep(0.1)  # sleep (or work) with the data\n            except ReceiverStoppedError:\n                pass\n\n\n        async def main() -&gt; None:\n            acast = Anycast[int](name=\"numbers\", limit=2)\n\n            async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as task_group:\n                task_group.create_task(send(\"sender_1\", acast.new_sender(), 10, 13))\n                task_group.create_task(send(\"sender_2\", acast.new_sender(), 20, 22))\n                task_group.create_task(recv(\"receiver_1\", acast.new_receiver()))\n                task_group.create_task(recv(\"receiver_2\", acast.new_receiver()))\n\n\n        asyncio.run(main())\n        ```\n\n        The output should look something like this(although the sending and received\n        might appear interleaved in a different way):\n\n        ```\n        sender_1 sending 10\n        sender_1 sending 11\n        sender_1 sending 12\n        Anycast channel [Anycast:numbers:_Sender] is full, blocking sender until a receiver\n        consumes a value\n        sender_2 sending 20\n        Anycast channel [Anycast:numbers:_Sender] is full, blocking sender until a receiver\n        consumes a value\n        receiver_1 received 10\n        receiver_1 received 11\n        sender_2 sending 21\n        Anycast channel [Anycast:numbers:_Sender] is full, blocking sender until a receiver\n        consumes a value\n        receiver_1 received 12\n        receiver_1 received 20\n        receiver_1 received 21\n        ```\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, *, name: str, limit: int = 10) -&gt; None:\n        \"\"\"Create an Anycast channel.\n\n        Args:\n            name: The name of the channel.

This will prevent further\n    attempts to [`send()`][frequenz.channels.Sender.send] data, and will allow\n    receivers to drain the pending items on their queues, but after that,\n    subsequent [receive()][frequenz.channels.Receiver.receive] calls will\n    raise a [`ReceiverStoppedError`][frequenz.channels.ReceiverStoppedError].\n\n    This channel is useful, for example, to implement a pub/sub pattern, where\n    multiple receivers can subscribe to a channel to receive all messages.\n\n    In cases where each message needs to be delivered only to one receiver, an\n    [anycast][frequenz.channels.Anycast] channel may be used.\n\n    # Examples\n\n    Example: Send a few numbers to a receiver\n        This is a very simple example that sends a few numbers from a single sender to\n        a single receiver.\n\n        ```python\n        import asyncio\n\n        from frequenz.channels import Broadcast, Sender\n\n\n        async def send(sender: Sender[int]) -&gt; None:\n            for msg in range(3):\n                print(f\"sending {msg}\")\n                await sender.send(msg)\n\n\n        async def main() -&gt; None:\n            channel = Broadcast[int](name=\"numbers\")\n\n            sender = channel.new_sender()\n            receiver = channel.new_receiver()\n\n            async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as task_group:\n                task_group.create_task(send(sender))\n                for _ in range(3):\n                    msg = await receiver.receive()\n                    print(f\"received {msg}\")\n                    await asyncio.sleep(0.1)  # sleep (or work) with the data\n\n\n        asyncio.run(main())\n        ```\n\n        The output should look something like (although the sending and received might\n        appear more interleaved):\n\n        ```\n        sending 0\n        sending 1\n        sending 2\n        received 0\n        received 1\n        received 2\n        ```\n\n    Example: Send a few number from multiple senders to multiple receivers\n        This is a more complex example that sends a few numbers from multiple senders to\n        multiple receivers, using a small buffer to force the senders to block.\n\n        ```python\n        import asyncio\n\n        from frequenz.channels import Broadcast, Receiver, ReceiverStoppedError, Sender\n\n\n        async def send(name: str, sender: Sender[int], start: int, stop: int) -&gt; None:\n            for msg in range(start, stop):\n                print(f\"{name} sending {msg}\")\n                await sender.send(msg)\n\n\n        async def recv(name: str, receiver: Receiver[int]) -&gt; None:\n            try:\n                async for msg in receiver:\n                    print(f\"{name} received {msg}\")\n                await asyncio.sleep(0.1)  # sleep (or work) with the data\n            except ReceiverStoppedError:\n                pass\n\n\n        async def main() -&gt; None:\n            acast = Broadcast[int](name=\"numbers\")\n\n            async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as task_group:\n                task_group.create_task(send(\"sender_1\", acast.new_sender(), 10, 13))\n                task_group.create_task(send(\"sender_2\", acast.new_sender(), 20, 22))\n                task_group.create_task(recv(\"receiver_1\", acast.new_receiver()))\n                task_group.create_task(recv(\"receiver_2\", acast.new_receiver()))\n\n\n        asyncio.run(main())\n        ```\n\n        The output should look something like this(although the sending and received\n        might appear interleaved in a different way):\n\n        ```\n        sender_1 sending 10\n        sender_1 sending 11\n        sender_1 sending 12\n        sender_2 sending 20\n        sender_2 sending 21\n        receiver_1 received 10\n        receiver_1 received 11\n        receiver_1 received 12\n        receiver_1 received 20\n        receiver_1 received 21\n        receiver_2 received 10\n        receiver_2 received 11\n        receiver_2 received 12\n        receiver_2 received 20\n        receiver_2 received 21\n        ```\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, *, name: str, resend_latest: bool = False) -&gt; None:\n        \"\"\"Create a Broadcast channel.\n\n        Args:\n            name: The name of the channel.
